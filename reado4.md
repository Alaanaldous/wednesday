# Process & Design

## who might be visiting your site and how to ensure the pages feature the information those visitors need,  we will look at:
* How to understand the audience your site may attract and
what information they will expect to find on it.
* How to organize information so that visitors can find what
they are looking for.
* Design theory for presenting information in a way that
helps visitors achieve their goals.
* Design tips to help you create more attractive and
professional sites.

## Who is the Site For?
### Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

## WireFrames:
### A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.


### Summary:
* It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
